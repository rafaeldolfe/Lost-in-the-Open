# Lost-in-the-Open
A Unity game inspired by the awesome FTL: Faster Than Light roguelike game developed by Subset Games. 

The game takes some of the core mechanics of FTL and employs them in the confines of a dangerous and mysterious sea. In your desperate attempt to escort the rightful king back to the disarrayed Rotherdale confederation, you see no other solution than to traverse the Deep Sea. Your crew is beset by all types of adversaries - unhinged pirates, underwater horrors, corrupt royals, cutthroat mercenaries and the ruthlessness of the sea itself. Your resolve is the only remaining anchor in this hopeless situation.
