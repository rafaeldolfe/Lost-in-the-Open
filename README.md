# Lost-in-the-Open
A Unity game inspired by the awesome FTL: Faster Than Light roguelike game developed by Subset Games. 

The game takes some of the core mechanics of FTL and employs them in the confines of a dangerous and mysterious sea. Your crew will be beset by all types of adversaries - pirates, underwater horrors, corrupt royals, cutthroat mercenaries and the ruthlessness of the sea itself. Your resolve is the only remaining anchor in this hopeless situation.
